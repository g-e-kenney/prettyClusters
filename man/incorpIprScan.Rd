\title{Subfunction to identify subgroups of hypothetical proteins in larger IMG datasets}
\usage{
incorpIprScan(
  iprScanSource = iprScanSource,
  imgNeighborsSource = imgNeighborsSource,
  geneName = geneName,
  addPfam = TRUE,
  addTigrfam = TRUE,
  addIPRfam = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{iprScanSource}{Data frame from neighborPrep with metadata for your genes of interest.}

\item{imgNeighborsSource}{Data frame from neighborPrep with metadata for neighbors of your genes of interest.}

\item{geneName}{Character string with your gene of interest's name}
}
\value{
Updated metadata for neighboring genes (additional files generated en route)
}
\description{
Given a desired genome neighborhood and lists of genes of interest and their neighbors, along with their protein sequences, this program uses all-by-all-blast & a clustering method of choice to identify subsets of hypothetical proteins that may represent meaningfully associated proteins.

incorpIprScanOut <- incorpIprScan(iprScanSource = "iprScan.txt", imgNeighborsSource = "fauxNeighborsData.txt", geneName = "genE", addPfam = TRUE, addTigrfam = TRUE)
